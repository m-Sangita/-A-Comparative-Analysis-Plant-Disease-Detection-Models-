# -A-Comparative-Analysis-Plant-Disease-Detection-Models-
–	A project that detects the plant diseases in rice, wheat, and corn crops using deep learning techniques, aiding in early disease identification for better crop management. Conducted a 
  comparative study using three different models to determine the most effective approach.
–	Utilized transfer learning and deep learning architectures to train models on large-scale datasets.
–	Employed computer vision to analyze lesion locations in annotated images, ensuring accurate disease classification.
